# Good Luck

## React - fetch & render
Fetch all the breeds and sub breed list from this endpoint on page/component load.

[https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all)

- Create a form and display the list of breed/sub-breed in select dropdown with this label "Pick your favorite breed".
- On select dropdown selection change fetch all the pictures of a specific breed using given below api.

For example if user selects "hound" breed.
[https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/images](https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/images)

- Display all the picture in 200x200 size with round border with black color and some shadow on it.
- On picture hover or focus change, update image border color to grey.
- If it's too many pictures on page try to add lazy load.
- Use responsive style to display the list of pictures.



## React render optimization
- Look at the ReactDebug component in components folder and see how we can improve the render.
- Find the performance issue and try to fix it.

## HTML CSS
- Build Percentile component using html, css.
- Imagine percentile.png image in assets folder is a design. 

## Bonus around technical challenge
- Explain how you will breakdown this work into components.
- Keep each small functionality in an individual component if possible.
- Clean code with comments in it.
- Error handling and show us how to test error handling if any of above API fails to respond.
- Loader animation while loading any data or pictures.
- Show/Explain us how we can test this code using Jest.
- Accessability attributes.
- Explain how this can be done with redux.
- Explain how to handle these APIs if it was secure.
